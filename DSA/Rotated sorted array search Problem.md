Sure, here is a comprehensive explanation of the rotated sorted array search problem, along with a detailed breakdown of the solution process:

**Problem Statement:**

Given a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot point, determine whether a given target value exists within the array. The array is assumed to be sorted in ascending order before being rotated.

**Solution Approach:**

The primary challenge in searching a rotated sorted array lies in identifying the pivot point, which is the location where the rotation occurred. Once the pivot point is identified, the array can be effectively divided into two sorted sub-arrays, and standard binary search can be employed to locate the target value.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Initialize pointers:** Define two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the starting and ending indices of the search range. Initially, set `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of the array minus 1.

2. **Check for trivial cases:** Before proceeding with the main search loop, handle two trivial cases:

    a. **Target equals the first element:** If the target value equals the first element of the array (i.e., `arr[low]`), then the target has been found, and its index is `low`.

    b. **Array contains only one element:** If the array contains only one element, check if it matches the target. If so, return its index; otherwise, return -1 indicating the target's absence.

3. **Identify the pivot point:** While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, perform the following steps:

    a. **Calculate the middle index:** Calculate the middle index, `mid`, using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.

    b. **Check for pivot point:** Compare the elements at `low`, `mid`, and `high`. If the element at `mid` is less than or equal to the element at `high`, the pivot point lies in the left sub array, so set `high` to `mid - 1`.

    c. **Update pivot point:** If the element at `mid` is greater than or equal to the element at `low`, the pivot point lies in the right subarray, so set `low` to `mid`.

4. **Perform binary search:** Once the pivot point has been identified, the array can be effectively divided into two sorted subarrays. Apply binary search to the appropriate subarray (left or right) to locate the target value.

    a. **Binary search logic:** Within the identified subarray, repeatedly update the search range by halving it until the target value is found or the subarray becomes empty. If the target value is within the current subarray, continue dividing the subarray and updating the search range. If the target value is not within the current subarray, move to the other subarray and repeat the process.

5. **Return the result:** After completing the binary search, if the target value is found, return its index. If the binary search exhausts all possibilities without finding the target, return -1 indicating its absence.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:**

The rotated sorted array search algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the input array. This efficiency stems from the utilization of binary search, which performs logarithmic-time operations. The identification of the pivot point adds a constant overhead, but it doesn't affect the overall asymptotic complexity.

**Conclusion:**

The rotated sorted array search problem poses a significant challenge due to the disruption of the sorted order. However, by identifying the pivot point and dividing the array into sorted subarrays, the problem can be effectively solved using binary search, achieving an efficient time complexity of O(log n).

__Vectors__:

1. Phys perspective : something having a magnitude and direction.
2. Comp perspective : Arrays -> collections of values.
3. Math perspective : Anything for which the following operations are defined(In your control).
	1.  Addition: a + b -> w and {a,b,w}== vectors.
	2.  Multiply with a scalar.;

__Vector Space__ : A set of vectors which is closed{ans should be in the same space.} under vector operations.

__Axioms for a vector space__ : 
1. closed under vector addition.
2. closed under scalar multiplication.
3. vector addition must be commutative.
4. vector addition is associative.
5. should have an additive identity.
6. should have additive inverse.
